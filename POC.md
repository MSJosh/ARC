Proof of Concept: Setting Up Azure ARC on Windows and Linux Servers
Introduction
This document outlines the process of setting up Azure ARC on Windows and Linux servers with the following items. 

- Azure subscription â€“ with proper permissions
- Supported systems and local access.
- Network Connectivity 
- Security Hardening
**Azure Subscription Setup**

Azure landing zones were designed with hybrid and multi-cloud in mind. To support hybrid and multi-cloud, the reference architecture requires two additions:
- Hybrid and multi-cloud connectivity: Understand key network design considerations and recommendations for working with Azure Arc.
- Unified operations: Include Azure Arc-enabled resources to extend your governance and operations support with consistent tooling.

**Permissions required to deploy Azure Arc.**
- Azure Connected Machine Onboarding Role: This role is required to onboard servers to Azure. This role can only be used to use onboard servers and cannot re-onboard or delete the server resource.
- Azure Connected Machine Resource Administrator Role: This role is required to read, modify, and delete a machine.
- Local Administrator or Root Access: To install and configure the Azure Connected Machine agent, you must have an account with elevated privileges (that is, an administrator or as root) on the machines.

- When connecting a large set of machines, it is recommended to utilize a service principal to handle onboarding without requiring manual interaction. [Connect hybrid machines to Azure at scale](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/onboard-service-principal)

**Supported Operating Systems**
Azure Arc supports the following Windows and Linux operating systems. Only x86-64 (64-bit) architectures are supported. The Azure Connected Machine agent does not run on x86 (32-bit) or ARM-based architecture.
